## What is A2A?

[A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A) (Agent2Agent) is an open protocol created by Google that enables different AI agents to communicate and collaborate with each other using a standardized interface. The protocol allows agents to discover capabilities, submit tasks for execution, monitor task progress, and receive task results in a unified way.

## Clients

AI clients that can interact with A2A servers:

* Claude from Anthropic
* Gemini from Google
* Custom A2A-compatible clients
