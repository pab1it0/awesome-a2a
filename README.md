## What is A2A?

[A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A) (Agent2Agent) is an open protocol created by Google that enables different AI agents to communicate and collaborate with each other using a standardized interface. The protocol allows agents to discover capabilities, submit tasks for execution, monitor task progress, and receive task results in a unified way.

## Clients

AI clients that can interact with A2A servers:

* Claude from Anthropic
* Gemini from Google
* Custom A2A-compatible clients

## Tutorials

* [Getting Started with A2A Protocol](https://google.github.io/A2A/#/documentation)
* [Building Your First A2A Server](https://github.com/google/A2A/blob/main/samples/python/README.md)

## Community

* [Google A2A GitHub](https://github.com/google/A2A)
